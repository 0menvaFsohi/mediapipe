In this article, we will show you how to download and install S7-PLCSIM V5.5 from the Siemens Industry Online Support website.
 
## Step 1: Download S7-PLCSIM V5.5
 
To download S7-PLCSIM V5.5, you need to have a valid license for STEP 7 V5.5 or higher. If you don't have one, you can download a trial version of STEP 7 Professional V17 from [here](https://support.industry.siemens.com/forum/ww/en/posts/v17-simatic-step-7-wincc-v17-trial-download/262153), which includes S7-PLCSIM V17[^3^].
 
If you have a license for STEP 7 V5.5 or higher, you can download S7-PLCSIM V5.5 from the Siemens Industry Mall website. Follow these steps:
 
1. Go to [this page](https://mall.industry.siemens.com/mall/en/WW/Catalog/Products/5000483) and click on "Ordering data" tab[^1^].
2. Find the product number that matches your license type (e.g. 6ES7810-4CC10-0YA5 for STEP 7 Professional) and click on "Add to cart".
3. Click on "Checkout" and log in with your Siemens account.
4. Follow the instructions to complete your order. You will receive an email with a download link and an activation code.

## Step 2: Install S7-PLCSIM V5.5
 
To install S7-PLCSIM V5.5, you need to have STEP 7 V5.5 or higher installed on your PC. If you don't have it, you can install it from the same download link as S7-PLCSIM V5.5.
 
Follow these steps to install S7-PLCSIM V5.5:

1. Run the downloaded file (e.g. SIMATIC\_S7\_PLCSIM\_V55\_SP4.exe) and follow the instructions of the setup wizard.
2. Enter the activation code that you received by email when prompted.
3. Select the components that you want to install (e.g. S7-PLCSIM, OPC Server, etc.).
4. Wait for the installation to finish and restart your PC if required.

## Step 3: Use S7-PLCSIM V5.5
 
To use S7-PLCSIM V5.5, you need to have a SIMATIC S7 project created with STEP 7 V5.5 or higher. You can also use the sample projects that are included with S7-PLCSIM V5.5.
 
Follow these steps to use S7-PLCSIM V5.5:

1. Open your SIMATIC S7 project with STEP 7 and select the CPU that you want to simulate.
2. Click on "Options" > "Set PG/PC Interface" and select "SIMATIC PC Adapter (Auto)" as the interface type.
3. Click on "OK" and then on "Load" to transfer your program to S7-PLCSIM.
4. Open S7-PLCSIM from the Windows Start menu or from the toolbar of STEP 7.
5. Select the CPU that you want to simulate and click on "Start".
6. You can now monitor and modify the inputs, outputs, flags, timers, counters, etc. of your simulated PLC.
7. You can also use other tools such as Win

## Step 4: Test your program with S7-PLCSIM V5.5

    With S7-PLCSIM V5.5, you can test your program in various scenarios and conditions without affecting the real PLC. You can also use the debugging and diagnostic tools of STEP 7 to troubleshoot your program.

    Some of the features that you can use with S7-PLCSIM V5.5 are:

    - Force inputs and outputs to simulate external signals.
    - Change the operating mode of the CPU (e.g. RUN, STOP, etc.).
    - Use breakpoints and watchpoints to pause and inspect your program.
    - Use the trace function to record and analyze the changes of variables over time.
    - Use the OPC Server to communicate with other applications (e.g. WinCC, Excel, etc.).

## Step 5: Transfer your program to a real PLC

    Once you are satisfied with your program and its performance on S7-PLCSIM V5.5, you can transfer it to a real PLC and run it on the actual hardware. You can use the same interface and steps as before, but you need to change the PG/PC interface to match your physical connection (e.g. MPI, PROFIBUS, Ethernet, etc.).

    Before transferring your program to a real PLC, make sure that:

    - You have a backup of your program and data.
    - You have checked the compatibility of your program with the PLC model and firmware.
    - You have configured the hardware and network settings of your PLC.
    - You have removed any forced values or breakpoints from S7-PLCSIM.

## Conclusion

    S7-PLCSIM V5.5 is a powerful and convenient tool that allows you to simulate and test your SIMATIC S7 programs on a PC without a physical PLC. It is compatible with STEP 7 V5.5, the programming software for SIMATIC S7 controllers.
