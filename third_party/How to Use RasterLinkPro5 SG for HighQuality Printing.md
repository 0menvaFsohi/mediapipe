## What is RasterLinkPro5 SG?
 
RasterLinkPro5 SG is a RIP (raster image processor) software that converts your digital images into printable data for Mimaki inkjet printers. It supports various Mimaki printer models, such as JV34-260, JV400LX Series, JV400SUV Series, JV5 Series, JV33 Series, and more. It also supports various file formats, such as TIFF, JPEG, EPS, PDF, and PSD.
 
RasterLinkPro5 SG has several features that make it a professional tool for printing:
 
- 16 bit rendering: This feature generates smoother gradations and finer details by using 16 bits per color channel instead of the usual 8 bits. This results in higher quality prints with less banding and noise.
- White layer printing: This feature allows you to print a white layer either under or over the CMYK layers on transparent materials. This helps to create more vivid images and enhance the contrast and saturation of the colors. You can customize the white layer area and print it simultaneously with the color layers for more precise registration.
- Web update function: This feature enables you to easily update your software and download new profiles from the Mimaki website. You can also check the supported OS and printer models from the web update function.
